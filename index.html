    Hello, human!
    What are you doing here?
    Are you deaf?
    Is your mic on?
    Anyway, do you know what's a paraboloid?
    You do? Great! I've just 3D-printed one.
    I'm stuck inside because of COVID-19.
    This page is temporary.
    Why am I writing this?
    How did you even answer me?
    What's future like?
    Ok, I'm gonna stop now.
    It was nice meeting you.
    Bye.
